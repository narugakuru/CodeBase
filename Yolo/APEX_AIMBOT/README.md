# Features
- Model can differentiate the enemy and friend
- PID smooth moving
- Individual process to display detection results in real time
- Customize personalized settings through config file
- Tensorrt speed up (solving the shaking problem when speed is fast)
- Encrypt onnx and trt model
- Save screenshot while locking or detected -> collect new dataset (false positive and negative)
- Annotate images using current models -> faster annotation
- Package to exe

# Environment
My envrionment uses python3.7
```
conda create -n apex python=3.7
conda activate apex
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pycuda
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install cuda11.8 with tensorrt following the [NVIDIA official instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/install-guide/index.html)

# Run 
Running for apex (default hold left/right button to auto aim, side button(x2) to auto aim and shoot, side button(x1) to enable and disable the AI:

```
python apex.py
```

Running for csgo (default hold side button(x2) to auto aim and shoot, side button(x1) to enable and disable the AI):

```
python csgo.py
```

You can get the customized settings in `configs/apex.yaml` or `configs/csgo.yaml`, set your suitable `smooth` hyperparameter

# Annotate the dataset using current model
```
python utils/anno_imgs.py --data_dir your_dataset_dir --engine_path your_trt_engine_path
```
